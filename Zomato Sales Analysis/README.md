## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Revenue Trends and Dynamics

* **Observation**: The line chart tracking monthly sales revenue reveals significant fluctuations, with the highest total revenue in January and the lowest in September. This suggests sales are influenced by seasonal demand.
* **Recommendation**: Continuously monitor monthly trends and investigate the root causes of revenue dips, especially in months like September, to build responsive sales strategies. Analyze mid-year drops (around month 9, where sales hit approximately 55M) to
* understand if they are due to seasonal trends or marketing inactivity.

### Top KPIs Revenue

* **Observation**: "North Indian, Chinese"  and "Indian" cuisines are the top revenue contributors, indicating strong sales performance
* in these categories.
* **Recommendation**: Analyze the high-performing sales of these cuisines to understand contributing factors. Monitor competitor pricing strategies to maintain competitiveness.

### Average Order Value (AOV)

* **Observation**: Tracking AOV over time shows whether customers are spending more or less per transaction. The highest sales quantity suggests effective high-value food sales.
* **Recommendation**: Introduce "frequently bought together" options to increase order size. Offer volume discounts and complementary items during checkout to encourage more purchases.

### Revenue by City and Menu

* **Observation**: The analysis highlights which cities and menus drive higher revenue, indicating best-selling items in specific locations. For instance, Tirupati shows a high revenue.
* **Recommendation**: Localize the menu based on city-level preferences. Analyze underperforming cities to understand local issues and increase promotion of top-selling food items in those areas.

### % of Revenue by Menu

* **Observation**: Revenue is almost equally distributed across three main menus (Menu/80384.json, Menu/377150.json, Menu/474086.json), each contributing roughly one-third (32.97%, 33.31%, 33.72% respectively). This balanced distribution suggests no single menu is disproportionately dominant or underperforming.
* **Recommendation**: Analyze profit margins even with balanced revenue share. Assess which menu has the highest sales amount and
* monitor distribution trends over time to identify emerging customer preferences.

### Revenue per Order by Cuisine

* **Observation**: Pizza cuisine has the highest median revenue per order, indicating consistent spending. Beverages show the lowest median and a tight range, pointing to low but stable revenue per order.
* **Recommendation**: Focus marketing efforts on pizza cuisine to build reliable revenue. Review pricing, portion sizes, and discounts
* on lower-performing items.

### Sales Quantity Over Time

* **Observation**: Consistent growth for menus with higher sales quantity indicates strong and increasing customer demand.
* Seasonal spikes might be influenced by factors like weather or holidays.
* **Recommendation**: Investigate declines in sales quantity, which could be due to menu unavailability or competition from new items.

## Conclusion

This sales analysis provides a strong story for Zomato, revealing geographic and cuisine-based strengths, opportunities to stabilize seasonal trends, and consistent menu performance with room for margin growth. By implementing the recommendations, 
Zomato can optimize its operations, enhance customer engagement, and drive sustained revenue growth.
