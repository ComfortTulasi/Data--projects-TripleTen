# Fresh Beats BI Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This project, "Sprint 0: Welcome Sprint: A First Look at Business Analytics," focuses on applying foundational business intelligence 
analytical skills to address real-world business challenges at Fresh Beats ðŸŽ¶. Fresh Beats is a dynamic online platform that serves as both 
a music streaming service and a platform for emerging musicians to gain visibility. The company generates revenue through 
partnerships with artists who pay for promotional services.

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, my task was to analyze provided data, visualizations, and insights to create a concise report for
stakeholders. The report summarizes key findings and offers recommendations to optimize operations and enhance business performance,
specifically focusing on user engagement, conversion, and artist promotion effectiveness.

## Business Challenges Addressed

Fresh Beats faces several strategic challenges:

* **Artist promotion effectiveness:** Evaluating and improving current artist promotion strategies to ensure maximum exposure and return on
*  investment for musicians.
* **User engagement and conversion:** Enhancing user engagement and converting free users into paid subscribers, crucial for sustained
* revenue growth tied to artist promotions.
* **Genre promotion for emerging artists:** Improving the platform's content recommendation system, particularly for promoting new and
*  emerging artists, by tailoring recommendations based on user preferences and music trends.

## Project Deliverables

The project involved populating a report template with relevant insights and visualizations, along with an original written summary. The key
components of the report include:

* **Project Summary:** Filled in all required fields, including the report date (01/19/2025), company name (Fresh Beats), and preparer
* (Tulasi).
* **Status Summary:** A concise summary (no more than two paragraphs) relating insights back to the business challenges.
* **Insights and Visualizations:** Selection of appropriate insights for each business need, accompanied by relevant visuals.
* **Recommendations:** Actionable recommendations based on the insights.

## Key Findings & Recommendations

### Status Summary

Indie is the most popular genre among paid users on the Fresh Beats platform. Electronic and Hip-Hop music genres are showing an overall 
upward trend in user engagement. This indicates potential growth areas for the platform, particularly in terms of user acquisition and
content expansion. User retention is stronger among paid users compared to free users, suggesting that conversion strategies are vital for
sustained growth.

To address the business challenges, Fresh Beats should focus on maximizing user retention in trending genres like electronic and hip hop. 
Given Indie's popularity with paid users, promotional efforts should be concentrated there. Furthermore, to convert free users, especially 
those listening to Rock (the most popular genre for free users), promotions offering free trials to convert to paid users should be explored 
. Overall, increasing the catalogue of electronic and hip hop tracks by soliciting appropriate artists and offering them deals is
recommended.
