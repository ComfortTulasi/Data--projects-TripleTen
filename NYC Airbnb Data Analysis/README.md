# Manhattan Airbnb Vacation Rental Market Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, "Spreadsheet Data Analysis" (Sprint 1),focuses on analyzing the Manhattan vacation rental market using Airbnb data. 
The primary objective was to provide recommendations to a client on attractive property types and neighborhoods for investment, as well 
as the potential revenue generated by these listings. The analysis heavily relied on data cleaning and pivot table techniques in a
spreadsheet environment.

## Key Questions Addressed

The analysis aimed to answer two main questions:

1.  **Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e., number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?**
2.  **How much money did these attractive listings generate?**

## Data Source

The project utilized the NYC Airbnb Data, specifically focusing on listings and calendar data.

## Methodology and Analysis

### Part 1: Identifying Attractive Listings

To determine the most attractive listings, the `number_of_reviews_ltm` (reviews in the last 12 months) column was used as a proxy for 
rental frequency and attractiveness.

* **Data Cleaning**:
    * The `neighborhood` column labels were cleaned by removing inconsistent capitalization and trailing spaces, storing clean values 
in a new column called `neighborhood_clean`.
    * The `bedrooms` column was cleaned of empty cells (representing studio apartments), with clean values stored in `bedrooms_clean`
using an `IF` function.

* **Neighborhood Attractiveness**:
    * A pivot table was built using `number_of_reviews_ltm` to identify the top 10 most attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals.
    * The top 3 most attractive neighborhoods identified were: **Midtown, Harlem, and Upper East Side**.
    * A bar chart was added to visualize the number of reviews for these top 10 neighborhoods.

* **Property Size Popularity**:
    * Another pivot table was created to determine the most popular number of bedrooms for rentals.
    * The 3 most popular property sizes were found to be: **Studios, 1-bedrooms, and 2-bedrooms**.

* **Neighborhood-Specific Property Preferences**:
    * The pivot table was updated to recommend specific property sizes for each of the top 10 neighborhoods.
    * For example, in **Harlem**, the most popular property size was identified as **1-bedroom**. For most top neighborhoods, 1-bedroom
listings were most popular, with the exception of Midtown, where studios were most popular.

### Part 2: Estimating Revenue Generation

This part focused on calculating the potential revenue from the identified "top listings" (listings in the top 10 neighborhoods with 
their most popular property size).

* **Identifying Top Listings**:
    * A new column, `top_listing`, was added to the `listings` data, with a value of `1` if a listing matched the criteria
(top 10 neighborhoods and their most popular property size), else `0`.

* **Calculating Revenue Earned**:
    * In the `calendar` data, a new column `revenue_earned` was created. If `available` was "f" (rented), `revenue_earned` was set to 
`adjusted_price`; otherwise, it was $0.
    * In the `listings` data, a `revenue_earned`column was created using `SUMIF()` to aggregate the total `revenue_earned` from the 
30-day `calendar` data for each property.

* **Ranking by Revenue**:
    * A pivot table was created to order all `top_listing` properties according to their 30-day `revenue_earned`.
    * The top-earning listing (ID: **709326903293880850**) earned **$29,940** over the 30-day period.

* **Annual Revenue Estimation**:
    * The annual revenue for recommended listings was estimated by multiplying the 30-day revenue by 12. For example, a listing earning 
$5,000 in 30 days was estimated to earn $60,000 annually.

## Project Deliverables

The project deliverables included a well-formatted spreadsheet with:

* Hidden unnecessary columns.
* An executive summary and a table of contents.
* Documented data cleaning steps in a change log.
* Clearly documented assumptions.
* Consistent formatting, borders, cell background colors, font styles, and sizes across the analysis.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The analysis provides clear guidance on which neighborhoods and property sizes in Manhattan are most attractive for vacation rentals 
and their potential earning capabilities. Investors should prioritize 1-bedroom listings in top neighborhoods like Midtown, Harlem, and 
Upper East Side, considering studios for Midtown. The revenue estimations demonstrate the significant financial potential of these 
strategically chosen properties.

## Technologies Used

* Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, pivot tables, and analysis)
* Google Sheets (for collaboration and sharing)
